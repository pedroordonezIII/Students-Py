# INF 360 - Programming in Python
# Pedro Ordonez
# Assignment Final Project

# 20 points: Does the program execute with no errors

# 20 points: The program should contain: Good flow control, good use of functions,
    # code should be as clean as possible (i.e. writing the smallest amount
    # of code necessary to complete the function), and contain examples
    # of lists or dictionaries

# 20 points: The project should be well documented. Make use of block and line
    # comments to describe the program as a whole, individual functions,
    # and major areas of the project

# 20 points: Use of the logging module. This should be used in place of where you
    # might have had print statements (unless your project was intended to
    # have console output. Refer to Chapter 10 â€“ Debugging. You should
    # import the module, setup the basic config, and then you must have a
    # combination of logging.debug and logging.critical statements used
    # appropriately. You can use any additional logging level you choose,
    # possibly logging.warning

# 20 points: Use of Object-Oriented Programming. This can be you creating your
    # own classes and modules OR the use of third party modules. If using
    # third party modules, be sure to put in the comments the
    # packages that need to be installed (probably from pip)

"""
This project will allow the user to store students in a dictionary which will add them to the course.
In addition, it will also allow the user to drop the students from the course. Finally, the program will
allow the user to enter grades for the specified student and calculate their average.  The program will first
add students into the course. It will then give the option to drop students from the course. The only way to drop
those students is if they are already in the course. Finally, the user will be able to calculate the students average
based on their scores.  The only way to calculate the students average is if the student is present in the course
As a result, the user will be able to add students into the class, remove students from the class if they drop the
course, and calculate their grade average.
